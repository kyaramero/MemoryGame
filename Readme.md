# Memory Gaylor

![taylor-swift-cover](readme_cover.png)

#### Overview

This was fun! A project linked to a person. Actually, the industry: Taylor Swift. Since I've had to practice my knowledge in Javascript, i chose a theme that I really like which is why this memory game is called Gaylor.

If to build a path you have to put a rock at a time, then i see this little project as a pop-start âœ¨ðŸ˜Ž

The design was made in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/RdZYyiN4lQRebUYe5PgpY6/MemoryGame_TaylorSwift?node-id=37%3A25), the logic was structured using a Flowchart (available in this folder). I also used Javascript, HTML and CSS to build.

Just like a memory game, the whole point here is to find matching cards with less moves every round.
